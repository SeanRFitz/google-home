This project helped me truly understand the box model, positioning (relative, fixed, absolute, and static), display (block, inline-block), and formatting text.

Margin is the outside of the box, the border is inside the margin, the padding is inside border, and the element is inside the padding.

Creating divs helps to keep the box model organized.

A block owns its line/area, while inline-blocks can be positioned like letters in a paragraph.

Relative positioning means change from its original position. Fixed means it will always occupy that spot on the page. Absolute means it will occupy the position based on the higher level box it is in.

I was left a little confused as to why Border: 100% doesn't exactly fit on the page. By using margin, I was able to move the border to fit, but it seemed odd to me.
